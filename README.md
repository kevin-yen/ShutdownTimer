# ShutdownTimer
Do something on a timer

Have you ever needed to go to bed, but you have a process that is not going to finish for anther 3 hours and you don't want to leave the computer on overnight and you are not using something expensive like a Mac or something weird like Linux? Boy do I have the software for you. The ShutdownTimer allows you to shutdown your computer after predetermined amount of time.

You can also
* Log off
* Restart
* Hibernate
* Show a message box
* Play a sound
* and more!

If you call in the next 15 minutes you can buy this for four payments of $19.99 a month...just kidding. It's open source. I wrote it in high school. It still somehow works. Have fun.
